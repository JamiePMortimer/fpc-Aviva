# WhatsApp Clone

Clone site of the Aviva frontpage page.

## Project aims

To produce a semi-functional frontpage of Aviva's website to practice and improve HTML, CSS & JS knowledge and skills and to expand knowledge range through the challenges faced in replicating the site.

It is not intended to link to other pages and isn't responsive so should only reliably render on desktops.

## Challenges

# Navigation Bar
Navigation sections are the bane of my life! Getting the structure correct definitely highlighted a huge gap in experience and knowledge of how to do this competently.
